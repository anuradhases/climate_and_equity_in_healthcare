## Project Overview
Metastatic TNBC is the most aggressive TBNC and requires urgent and timely treatment. There are unnecessary delays in diagnosis and subsequent treatment can have devastating effects. The differences in wait time for treatment is a good proxy for disparities in healthcare access. The primary question that the model will answer is to predict the duration of time it takes for 13173 patients to receive metastatic cancer diagnosis, with a basis of 152 features.

## Purpose
The primary purpose is to determine whether disparate treatments exist, and understand drivers of those biases (e.g. demographic, societal factors).
The secondary purpose is to see how climate patterns impact access to healthcare.

## Data Source
The primary source of data is from Health Verity, and the seconday source is Gilead. Two datasets are provided (train, test). Variables include demographics, diagnosis and treatment options, insurance and zip code climate data. "Train" contains observed values of metastatic diagnosis period for each observation and "Test" withholds the metastatic diagnosis period to test the accuracy of the model.
